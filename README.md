-  Online course material from the Code Institute to learn HTML and CSS alongside W3Schools, Stack Overflow, CodePen and YouTube.
-  I used the Mimo app as an additional learning path which helped with step-by-step practice and also offered snippets of new code that I hadn't picked up through the Code Institute modules.

## Design and Content Structure

### Logos
The logo is set in an elegant, gentle font with serif detailing to reference the bespoke service Griefwell offers. A special font was used on the hero landing page image to set the scene; a bright yellow was used in deliberate contrast to the otherwise earthy colours of the site, to give a modern twist and to add a positive, uplifting element to it.

### Font
"Cormorant + Garamond" was defined as the main font family to be used across the entire site. Various font weights are being used for stylistic reasons, to differentiate between headings, body and navigation text.

### Color Scheme
A subdued colour palette in pastel tones has been chosen to create a gentle website environment that feels inviting and open to a potential female client base. 

### Header
The same header is used across the site to hold the navigation bar and the site title.

### Navigation Bar
* The navigation bar appears on all four pages. 
* It contains links to Home, About, Services and Contact pages.
* The menu sits in a horizontal flow for larger screen sizes and turns into a burger menu for mobile and tablet.

### Footer
* The footer is replicated across all pages, deliberately sticking to the the bottom of each page, acting as a re-enforcement of the Griefwell brand and name.

## Future-Enhancements

* Create more varied layouts across each page in order to feel less repetitive and more engaging for the user.
* Add two more photos to the About page: one of Felicia McDonald and one black and white childhood photo of her with her mother.
* Add a form to the Contact page so that users can send direct messages to Felicia McDonald without having to leave the site.
* Evolve the website into membership community platform where potential clients can subscribe to a grief community where different offerings can be found: events, coaching, complementing services by other consultants, a shop (offering products related to grief such as books, candles, etc...).

## Testing

The W3C Markup Validation Service and W3C CSS Validation Service were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.
    
**HOME** page:

Initial tests show four warnings and two errors to be corrected.
![Initial test results](/validation/w3c_validator/errors/project_1_index.png)
After fixing the errors, the final test results confirm no errors. I've left the warnings untouched as there are no relevant headings to be added.
![Final test results](/validation/w3c_validator/errors_solved/project_1_index_solved.png)

**SERVICES** page:

Initial tests show two errors and the same warnings as the HOME page to be corrected.
![Initial test results](/validation/w3c_validator/errors/project_1_services.png)
After fixing the errors, the final test results confirm no errors. I've left the warnings untouched as there are no relevant headings to be added.

**CONTACT** page:

Initial tests show two errors and the same warnings as the HOME page to be corrected.

After fixing the errors, the final test results confirm no errors. I've left the warnings untouched as there are no relevant headings to be added.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, using DevTools across various breakpoints for mobile, tablet, laptop and desktop.
-   All links were tested across all pages and device breakpoints.

## Performance

Google Chrome Lighthouse was used to calculate performance scores. All pages achieved green light across all elements: performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO.

### Accessibility
Making the website accessible was paramount in order to adhere to web standards but also, to be able to reach as wide an audience as possible and to make the user experience across various devices as user friendly as possible.

* Semantic elements are used throughout the website.
* All images were converted into WEBP, a reduced file size to support the load time of images (https://image.online-convert.com/).
* All images contained an alt tag whenever possible.
* The site is responsive to different screen sizes.
